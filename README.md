This is the repository of the EC500 C1 class project
The Mask.py creates the mask for the nodules inside a image 
The lung.py generates the training and testing data sets, which would be ready to feed into the the U-net.py to train with.
U-net.py trains the data with U-net structure CNN, and gives out the result
The data sets can be accessed from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0Bz-jINrxV740SWE1UjR4RXFKRm8
To run this, you would need the tensorflow installed, and some sevral other python packages, but all are easy to install
Download the dataset, and change the directory for this to run properly
